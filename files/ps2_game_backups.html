These are not different emulators you can choose from, they are the specific software components used by different console models to run PS2™ games.","#Software Emulator (ps2_netemu.self):","This is the most common emulator and the one used by all systems to emulate PS2™ games.","A software-based emulator and the name stands for \\"Network Emulator\\". It was originally designed only to play the \\"PS2™ Classics\\" that Sony sold and distributed over the PlayStation®Network (PSN™).","Consoles that use it:","-All console models.","How it works:","-Official Firmware: The emulator can only run official \\"PS2™ Classics\\" downloaded from the PSN™ store.","-Custom Firmware: The emulator is \\"unlocked\\" to allow it to load and play PS2™ ISO files directly from the console&apos;s internal hard drive.","-Hybrid Firmware: The emulator is \\"unlocked\\" to allow it to load and play PS2™ Encrypted ISO files directly from the console&apos;s internal hard drive.","Compatibility:","-This emulator has good compatibility, but it is not perfect. Many games require specific [\47config\47 files](http://0/install.ps3?url=https://github.com/PS3-Pro/Packages/releases/download/Homebrews/PS2_Configuration_Database.pkg) to fix graphical glitches, performance issues, or sound bugs.","#Hybrid Emulator (ps2_emu.self):","This is the emulator used by the \\"middle generation\\" of \\"Fat\\" consoles that had partial backward compatibility.","Consoles that use it:","-\\"Fat\\" models (CECH-CXX/CECH-EXX) with the PS2™ Graphics Synthesizer (GS) chip on the motherboard, but no PS2™ Emotion Engine (EE) CPU.","How it works:","-This software emulates the PS2&apos;s CPU (Emotion Engine) using the PS3&apos;s Cell processor. However, it processes graphics by using the real, physical PS2™ GPU (Graphics Synthesizer) chip that is built into the console.","Compatibility:","-Very high (often 90%+). Because the graphics are handled by native hardware, it avoids most of the graphical glitches seen on ps2_netemu and the compatibility can be increased by [\47config\47 files](http://0/install.ps3?url=https://github.com/PS3-Pro/Packages/releases/download/Homebrews/PS2_Configuration_Database.pkg) to fix graphical glitches, performance issues, or sound bugs.","#Hardware Emulator (ps2_gxemu.self):","This isn&apos;t an \\"emulator\\" in the traditional sense. It&apos;s the name for the system that manages the full hardware backward compatibility. The \\"GX\\" refers to the graphics hardware.","Consoles that use it:","-The original \\"Fat\\" launch models (CECHAXX/CECHBXX) with full hardware backward compatibility.","How it works:","-This is not emulation. When a PS2™ game is launched, the console uses the physical PS2™ CPU (Emotion Engine) and the physical PS2™ GPU (Graphics Synthesizer) that are on its motherboard. The console essentially becomes a PS2™.","Compatibility:","-The best possible (95%+).
